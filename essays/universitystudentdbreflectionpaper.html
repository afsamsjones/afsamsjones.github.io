<h2 id="introductionproject-summary">Introduction/Project Summary</h2>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>The purpose of the Online University Student Database is to provide administrators with the capability to enter a wide variety of data points for incoming students. The GUI will allow the user to enter information (student name, home address, social security number, date of birth, picture ID, declared major, degree program, grades, instructor information, create and assign courses to students and instructors, enter and process tuition payments, etc.) The data entered will allow users to generate various reports based on specified criteria (student grade reports, tuition due, payments, enrolled classes, etc.).</p>

<h5 id="overview">Overview</h5>
<p>Project Title: Online University Student Database
Customers: Student Affairs department
Developers: Allesandra Sams-Jones
Users: Admissions advisors, academic advisors, financial advisors, 
Project Manager: Professor Scott Cordle</p>

<h5 id="system-description">System Description</h5>
<p>System Requirements
	This database is designed for laptop and desktop use. All potential users must have Microsoft Access installed on their workstations.
Major Feature Specifications</p>
<ol>
  <li>Users will be able to enter all data into a GUI. That data will be available immediately to all approved users.</li>
  <li>Data will only be accessible to admissions advisers, academic advisers, and their leaders based on role-based security constraints.</li>
  <li>Various elements can be entered and tracked included, but not limited to student personal/contact information, grades, enrolled courses, financial obligations, instructor class assignments, etc.</li>
  <li>Users will be able to export/email reports in various formats.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="database-security">Database Security</h5>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Before any university employee can access the database, the database administrator will need to enter roles and access levels in the Access Level table, then enter users and their role-based access levels in the User table. This is accessed by completing the security requirements, then choosing the Database Security Portal on the main menu. ##### Student Admissions As students are admitted into the university, the admissions user will open the database. The first screen that appears is the login screen (Appendix C). The user will enter the username and password, and click the LOGIN button to open the menu. If the wrong password is entered, an error message (Password does not match, please re-enter) is generated. If the user doesn’t have proper clearance another error, (You are not authorized to access this form) is generated. Upon verification of ID, the admissions employee will access the main menu (Appendix D) and choose the Student Admissions portal (Appendix E) and will enter all of the required data elements and assign a student ID to the new student. Admission ID is automatically generated and is the primary key.  ##### Enroll in Classes The course enrollment user will follow the same password verification process, and from the menu, open the Enrollment Portal (Appendix F), choose the Student ID from the drop-down box, and enter each course the user will take.  It prefills the degree program and declared major to assist the user in determining which classes to enroll the student in. For ease of use, there are tabs provided with the course lists for all degree programs offered by the university. ##### Enter Grades Instructors will follow the same password verification process, open the Enter Course Grades Portal (Appendix G) and, within the list of classes being taken currently, locate their student. He/she can enter the grades for students, change the status from Current to Completed, then exit the form. ##### Create Instructors The Create Instructors Portal (Appendix H) allows the human resources employee the capability to enter a new instructor’s name, rank, and bi-weekly salary. The primary key is Instructor ID, which is created by the user. The annual salary is a calculated field based on what is entered in the bi-weekly salary field. ##### Create Courses The Course Creation Portal (Appendix I) allows the user, after completing the password verification process, to create a course by entering the course ID, course name, credit hours, prerequisite, and assign an instructor. After saving the record(s) the form can be exited.  ##### Process Tuition Payments The Tuition Payments Portal (Appendix J) allows the user to enter tuition payments received from the student or other entities. The system generates a payment ID and a drop-down box locates the student ID. The user enters the pay date, pay method, authorization or check number (if received), credit card type (if needed), and the payment amount. After each transaction is saved, the user can close the form/database. ##### Student Account Ledger The Student Account Ledgers Portal (Appendix K) allows the finance employee to review the student financial statement. The user has two report options:  review all students or choose a specific student. When choosing a specific student’s report, the student’s home and school email are prefilled in order to provide that information to the user if they prefer to email the report to the student.  ##### Student Grade Report The Student Grade Report (Appendix L) provides a report for each student showing their list of classes, the grade received, the quality points, and GPA. ##### Societal impact of project including legal and ethical considerations
There are potential legal and ethical considerations to consider with this database. Although each portal is password protected, there could be issues when an employee is also a family member of a student. A conflict of interest could arise if that employee has the capability to alter student tuition payments or change student grades to benefit their family member.  ##### Conclusions
No additional hardware is needed for this software at this time. Users may choose to access the database from a laptop or a desktop computer. The database has been split so that the front end can be placed on the user’s workstation; the backend is housed on a network drive.  ##### Recommendations for Future Work
There are a number of enhancements that can be made as the university’s needs change: 1.	If, at any point, the university decides to offer housing, the database could be updated to include that information.  2.	There is potential to expand Human Resources’ footprint within the database by adding employee payroll and accounting data.  3.	Create a system log table that documents changes made by all employees 4.	Lock down student records when an employee attempts to access them.  5.	Move the database to a platform that supports mobile phone access.
