Guess My Number is a game that gives the user the option to choose different number ranges for guessing. The player is encouraged to guess the number based on greater than and less than feedback.

I was the sole programmer for this project. My goal was to demonstrate my expertise with C# by creating a game. I chose this game as a fun, educational way for children to develop their cognitive skills.
