The University Student Database was designed to provide various university staff employees with a stand-alone application with a graphical user interface to document all aspects of an online college student's collegiate life. From admission, to enrollment, to payment, this database provided the university with the tools to accurately reflect all data elements associated with any student. 

As the sole programmer for this project, my goal was to display my understanding of the concepts of system design with a stand-alone application.
